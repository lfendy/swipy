# Swipy - Because everyday is a struggle, and you need a reward.
## What is 'Swipy'?
Pronounced 'Swee-pee'.  
Every day you get up out of bed, or not. You go to work, or not. You eat food, or not. You breathe, I hope. You do stuff, check facebook, use your car, elevators, escalators .. stuff. Every day life should not be taken for granted. So we created 'Swipy'!  
Swipy is a single player game that reward you for you just living and doing things we all do. You may take it for granted, but we sure don't.

## How does it work?
We have harnessed the power of tinder to bring you a experience that is extremely easy to use. Use your tried and tested tinder motions of swipe left or right to answer yes or no to a series of questions based on a particular context and you may or may not be rewarded!

At the moment this is only an android app. We don't care about ios users.
not released yet but soon to be! Stay tuned!
